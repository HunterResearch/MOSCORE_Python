The file outputs/Phantom_with_budget=200_n0=10_delta=10_mreps=5.pickle contains the MORS Tester object for the following experiment: 

MORS Problem:
	number of objectives = 2
	number of systems = 3

	system 0 has true means [1, 0] and covariance matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
	system 1 has true means [0, 1] and covariance matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
	system 2 has true means [1, 1] and covariance matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

MORS Solver:
	allocation rule = Phantom
	budget = 200
	n0 = 10
	delta = 10

5 macroreplications were run:
	macroreplication 0: avg time per allocation call = 0.048104 s
	macroreplication 1: avg time per allocation call = 0.116018 s
	macroreplication 2: avg time per allocation call = 0.111996 s
	macroreplication 3: avg time per allocation call = 0.059167 s
	macroreplication 4: avg time per allocation call = 0.052695 s
