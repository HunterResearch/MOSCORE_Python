# MOSCORE_Work
Working repository for Matlab/Octave and Python implementations of MOSCORE algorithms.

To get started, locate the following in the AllocAlgs folder:
1) Prod_Allocation_TrueBF.m ==> Brute Force (Problem Q)
2) Prod_Allocation_True.m ==> Phantom (Problem Q^{ph})
3) Prod_Allocation_S.m ==> MOSCORE
4) Prod_Allocation_iS2.m ==> iMOSCORE

(When we were first submitting the paper, we were in the midst of changing what we called each algorithm, thus the weird names of the programs.)

Once you're in each m-file, you'll see which other functions/programs are called from the RateCalcs folder or Utilities folder.

Any questions, please contact Eric.
